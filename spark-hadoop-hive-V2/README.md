# HDFS/Spark/Hive Local Development Setup

This repository provides the installation instructions for
* Hadoop 2.7.2,
* Spark 2.0.0 and
* Hive 2.1.0
for development on a local machine. SANSA stack developers use this environment setup for development and debugging. As we run our production code in docker containers, docker-driven CI is a part of our delivery cycle as well.

Our developers use Ubuntu LTS and organize their work inside dedicated ~/Workspace directory. If you do not know where to install your HDFS/Spark/Hive setup, then put it into ~/Workspace/hadoop-spark-hive directory. After the installation the directory will be contains the following:
```
├── data
├── Makefile
├── src
└── tools
    ├── apache-hive-2.1.0-bin
    ├── hadoop-2.7.2
    └── spark-1.6.2-bin-without-hadoop
```
* Makefile. Used for running various tasks such as starting up the hadoop/spark/hive, running interactive shells for spark/hive etc.
* src/ directory. Contains git repositories with various spark applications.
* tools/ directory. Contains hadoop/spark/hive binaries.
* data/ directory contains HDFS data and spark-rdd data.

## Usage

Clone this repository into the folder where you want to create your HDFS/Spark/Hive setup:
```
mkdir -p ~/Workspace/hadoop-spark-hive && cd ~/Workspace/hadoop-spark-hive
git clone https://github.com/earthquakesan/hdfs-spark-hive-dev-setup ./
```

### Download HDFS/Spark/Hive binaries

```
make download
```

After this step you should have tools/ folder with the following structure:
```
└── tools
    ├── apache-hive-2.1.0-bin
    ├── hadoop-2.7.2
    └── spark-2.0.0-bin
```

### Configure HDFS/Spark
```
make configure
```

### Start HDFS
Start hadoop DFS (distributed file system), basically 1 namenode and 1 datanode:
```
make start_hadoop
```

Open your browser and go to localhost:50070. If you can open the page and see 1 datanode registered on your namenode, then hadoop setup is finished.

### Start Spark
Start local Spark cluster:
```
make start_spark
```

Open your browser and go to localhost:8080. If you can open the page and see 1 spark-worker registered with spark-master, then spark setup is finished.

### Configure Hive
Hadoop should be running for Hive configuration:
```
make configure_hive
```

### Start Hive Metastore
```
make start_hive_postgres_metastore
```
This command will first start Postgresql docker container on your local docker host and then start the metastore (will occupy the terminal session). In case, you need to install docker, please refer [to official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). In a case if docker container did not start up completely when you start metastore you will get an error. Then you will need to start metastore manually:
```
make activate
source activate
hive --service metastore
```

### Start Hive
Run the Hive server (it will occupy the terminal session, providing server logs to it):
```
make start_hive_server
```

Start beeline client to connect to the Hive server (you might not be able to connect if you are too fast, the Hive server takes time to start up):
```
make start_hive_beeline_client
```

Execute some queries to see if the Hive server works properly:
```
CREATE TABLE pokes (foo INT, bar STRING);
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH './tools/apache-hive-2.1.0-bin/examples/files/kv1.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE pokes;
DESCRIBE pokes;
```

## Misc

### Adding sample data to Hive

Assuming that you have hadoop/spark/hive_server running, start the beeline client:
```
make start_hive_beeline_client
```

Then load the sample data as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE pokes (foo INT, bar STRING);
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH './tools/apache-hive-2.1.0-bin/examples/files/kv1.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE pokes;
```

### Stopping HDFS/Spark/Hive
To stop HDFS:
```
make stop_hadoop
```

To stop Spark:
```
make stop_spark
```

To stop Hive you need to open terminal session, CTRL+Z and then kill the process by its pid:
```
kill -9 pid
```
